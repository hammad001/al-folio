I am a first year PhD student at the Dept. of Computer Sicence, [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/). 

My research interests focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Commonsense Reasoning. Particularly, I am interested in finding out structured representation of the world from multi-modal data. 

Prior to joining Columbia, I finished my Master's at UC San Diego, advised by [Prof. Gary Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/). I also worked with [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/) and [Prof. David Kriegman](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kriegman/) during that time. I finished my Bachelor's at Indian Institute of Technology, BHU ([IIT, BHU](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/)).
