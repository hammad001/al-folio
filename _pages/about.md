I am a final year PhD student at the Dept. of Computer Sicence, [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/). 

My research interests focuses on Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Commonsense Reasoning. In particular, I am interested in building systems that can reason about our world in an interpretable, robust, and trustworthy manner. This involves extensive work with LLMs, agents, tools, and instruction-tuning.

I have been fortunate to have worked with some amazing people via internships at Microsoft, Google and Adobe -- [Jianwei Yang](https://jwyang.github.io/), [Oriana Riva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Eo7-pZ4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Tianqi Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pUKhiMIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Arsha Nagrani](https://a-nagrani.github.io/), [Mingda Zhang](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~mzhang/), [Anurag Arnab](https://anuragarnab.github.io/), and [Vlad Morariu](https://research.adobe.com/person/vlad-morariu/).

Prior to joining Columbia, I finished my Master's at UC San Diego, advised by [Prof. Gary Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/). I also worked with [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/) and [Prof. David Kriegman](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kriegman/) during that time. I finished my Bachelor's at Indian Institute of Technology, BHU ([IIT, BHU](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/)).
